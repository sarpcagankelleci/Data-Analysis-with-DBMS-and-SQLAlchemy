# Data-Analysis-with-DBMS-and-SQLAlchemy-

This repository contains the submission for COMP306 Database Management Systems,by Sarp Çağan Kelleci.

## Files

- `DataAnalysis.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the Python code for database management, data analysis, and machine learning tasks. It includes connections to a MySQL database using SQLAlchemy, data manipulation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning model development.
- `world-export.sql`: This SQL file includes the necessary database queries used to extract and manipulate data for analysis and machine learning tasks.

## Overview

This homework focuses on integrating database management, data analysis, and machine learning using Python and SQLAlchemy. The tasks include:

- **MySQL Database Connection with SQLAlchemy**: Establishing a connection to a MySQL database using SQLAlchemy, a popular Object Relational Mapper (ORM) library for Python.
- **Data Extraction and Manipulation**: Extracting data from the database and performing data cleaning and preprocessing using `pandas`.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize key trends and insights using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- **Machine Learning**: Applying machine learning techniques (model training, evaluation, and prediction) to analyze data, leveraging Python’s `scikit-learn` library.
- **Visualization**: Visualizing results and insights from both the data analysis and machine learning models.
